<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Secret</h1>

<h3>DISCLAIMER: I'm new to GitHub, so if i make a mistake please let me know!</h3>

I love electronics and, of course, programming (mainly in python, but i can improvise well. (at least i think so)).
Im currently working on a couple of projects but am too busy to get actual motivation for them.
Also, im bad at describing myself like this. Maybe ill add something to this file later, maybe ill forget about it for a few months.

Btw i use tabs instead of spaces. (4 space width)
